# Overview

The navigation in the App consists of a top-level Stack Navigator (called `RootStack`) with each of its `Screen` components handling different high-level flow. All those flows can be seen in `AuthScreens.tsx` file.

## Terminology

`RHP` - Right hand panel that shows content inside a dismissible modal that takes up a partial portion of the screen on large format devices e.g. desktop/web/tablets. On smaller screens, the content shown in the RHP fills the entire screen.

Navigation Actions - User actions correspond to resulting navigation actions that we will define now. The navigation actions are: `Back`, `Up`, `Dismiss`, `Forward` and `Push`.

- `Back` - Moves the user “back” in the history stack by popping the screen or stack of screens. Note: This can potentially make the user exit the app itself (native) or display a previous app (not Expensify), or just the empty state of the browser.

- `Up` - Pops the current screen off the current stack. This action is very easy to confuse with `Back`. Unless you’ve navigated from one screen to a nested screen in a stack of screens, these actions will almost always be the same. Unlike a “back” action, “up” should never result in the user exiting the app and should only be an option if there is somewhere to go “up” to.

- `Dismiss` - Closes any modals (outside the navigation hierarchy) or pops a nested stack of screens off returning the user to the previous screen in the main stack.

- `Forward` - This will take you forward in the history stack. Can only be invoked after you have gone `Back` at least once. Note: Only possible on web.

- `Push` - Either adds a new individual screen to the main stack or a nested stack of screens to the main stack with the user pointed at the last index of the pushed stack.

## Adding RHP flows

Most of the time, if you want to add some of the flows concerning one of your reports, e.g. `Money Request` from a user, you will most probably use `RightModalNavigator.tsx` and `ModalStackNavigators.tsx` file:

- Since each of those flows is kind of a modal stack, if you want to add a page to the existing flow, you should just add a page to the correct stack in `ModalStackNavigators.tsx`.

- If you want to create new flow, add a `Screen` in `RightModalNavigator.tsx` and make new modal in `ModalStackNavigators.tsx` with chosen pages.

When creating RHP flows, you have to remember a couple of things:

- Since you can deeplink to different pages inside the RHP navigator, it is important to provide the possibility for the user to properly navigate back from any page with UP press (`HeaderWithBackButton` component).

- An example can be deeplinking to `/settings/profile/timezone/select`. From there, when pressing the UP button, you should navigate to `/settings/profile/timezone`, so in order for it to work, you should provide the correct route in `onBackButtonPress` prop of `HeaderWithBackButton` (`Navigation.goBack(ROUTES.SETTINGS_PROFILE)` in this example). 

- We use a custom `goBack` function to handle the browser and the `react-navigation` history stack. Under the hood, it resolves to either replacing the current screen with the one we navigate to (deeplinking scenario) or just going back if we reached the current page by navigating in App (pops the screen). It ensures the requested behaviors on web, which is navigating back to the place from where you deeplinked when going into the RHP flow by it.

- If you want to navigate to a certain report after completing a flow related to it, e.g. `RequestMoney` flow with a certain group/user, you should use `Navigation.dismissModal` with this `reportID` as an argument. If, in the future, we would like to navigate to something different than the report after such flows, the API should be rather easy to change. We do it like that in order to replace the RHP flow with the new report instead of pushing it, so pressing the back button does not navigate back to the ending page of the flow. If we were to navigate to the same report, we just pop the RHP modal.

### Example of usage

An example of adding `Settings_Workspaces` page:

1. Add the page name to `SCREENS.ts` which will be reused throughout the app (linkingConfig, navigators, etc.):
    
```ts
const SCREENS = {
    SETTINGS: {
        WORKSPACES: 'Settings_Workspaces',
    },
} as const;
```

2. Add path to `ROUTES.ts`: https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/ROUTES.ts

```ts
export const ROUTES = {
    // static route
    SETTINGS_WORKSPACES: 'settings/workspaces',
    // dynamic route
    SETTINGS_WORKSPACES: {
        route: 'settings/:accountID',
        getRoute: (accountID: number) => `settings/${accountID}` as const,
    },
};

```

3. Add `Settings_Workspaces` page to proper RHP flow in `linkingConfig.ts`: https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/fbc11ca729ffa4676fb3bc8cd110ac3890debff6/src/libs/Navigation/linkingConfig.ts#L47-L50

4. Add your page to proper navigator (it should be aligned with where you've put it in the previous step) https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/fbc11ca729ffa4676fb3bc8cd110ac3890debff6/src/libs/Navigation/AppNavigator/ModalStackNavigators.js#L141

5. Make sure `HeaderWithBackButton` leads to the previous page in navigation flow of your page: https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/3531af22dcadaa94ed11eccf370517dca0b8c305/src/pages/workspace/WorkspacesListPage.js#L186

## Performance solutions

Using [react-freeze](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-freeze) allows us to increase performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders of screens that aren’t visible to the user anyway.

- To ensure that the user doesn't ever see frozen report content, we are freezing the screens from 2 levels down the `RootStack` (which contains a `Screen` for each report), so when dismissing with a swipe, the user always sees the content of the previous report.

- We want to freeze as high in the view hierarchy as we can, so we do it in a `Screen` of `RootStack`, being `CentralPaneNavigator` and `SidebarScreen`.

- We want the report content visible as fast as possible, and at the same time we want the navigation animation to trigger instantly. To do so, we do a hack with `firstRenderRef` which renders `ReportActionsSkeletonView` instead of the messages at the first render, and the proper content afterward. It works since there are always more renders of `ReportScreen` before the content shows up (hopefully).

## Handling wide and narrow layouts

- The wide and narrow layouts are conditionally rendered with different components in `createResponsiveNavigator` depending on screen size (`isSmallScreen` prop from the `withWindowDimension.js`).

- The wide layout is rendered with our custom `ThreePaneView.js` and the narrow layout is rendered with `StackView` from `@react-navigation/stack`

- To make sure that we have the correct navigation state after changing the layout, we need to force react to create new instance of the `NavigationContainer`. Without this, the navigation state could be broken after changing the type of layout.

- We are getting the new instance by changing the `key` prop of `NavigationContainer` that depends on the `isSmallScreenWidth`.

- To keep the navigation state that was present before changing the layout, we save the state on every change and use it for the `initialState` prop.
Changing the layout means that every component inside `NavigationContainer` is mounted anew.

## Why we need to use minimal action in the `linkTo` function

### The problem 
Let's assume that the user wants to navigate like this:

```
1. Settings_root - navigate > Profile
2. Profile - UP > Settings_root
3. Settings_root - navigate > About 
4. About - browser back button > Settings_root
```

Without minimal action, expected behavior won't be achieved and the final screen will be `Profile`.

Broken behavior is the outcome of two things:
1. Back button in the browser resets the navigation state with the state saved in step two.
   
2. `Navigation.navigate` creates action with `getActionFromState` dispatched at the top level of the navigation hierarchy. 

The reason why `getActionFromState` provided by `react-navigation` is dispatched at the top level of the navigation hierarchy is that it doesn't know about current navigation state, only about desired one.

In this example, it doesn't know if the `RightModalNavigator` and `Settings` are already mounted.


The action for the first step looks like that:

```json
{
    "type": "NAVIGATE",
    "payload": {
        "name": "RightModalNavigator",
        "params": {
            "initial": true,
            "screen": "Settings",
            "params": {
                "initial": true,
                "screen": "Profile",
            }
        }
    }
}
```


That means, the params for the `RightModalNavigator` and `Settings` (also a navigator) will be filled with the information that we want to have the `Profile` screen in the state.

```json
{
    "index": 2,
    "routes": [
        { "name": "Home", },
        {
            "name": "RightModalNavigator",
            // here you can see that the params are filled with the information about structure that should be in the state.
            "params": {
                "initial": true,
                "screen": "Settings",
                "params": {
                    "initial": true,
                    "screen": "Settings_Profile",
                    "path": "/settings/profile"
                }
            },
            "state": {
                "index": 0,
                "routes": [
                    {
                        "name": "Settings",
                        // Same here
                        "params": {
                            "initial": true,
                            "screen": "Settings_Profile",
                            "path": "/settings/profile"
                        },
                        "state": {
                            "index": 0,
                            "routes": [
                                {
                                    "name": "Settings_Profile"
                                }
                            ]
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

This information will stay here even if we pop the `Profile` screen and navigate to `About` screen. 

Later on, when the user presses the browser back button expecting that the `Settings_root` screen will appear, the navigation state will be reset with information about the `Profile` screen in the params and this will be used as a source of truth for the navigation. 

### The solution

If we can create simple action that will only push one screen to the existing navigator, we won't fill any params of the navigators. 

The `getMinimalAction` compares action generated by the `getActionFromState` with the current navigation state and tries to find the smallest action possible.

The action for the first step created with `getMinimalAction` looks like this:

```json
{
    "type": "NAVIGATE",
    "payload": {
        "name": "Settings_Profile"
    },
    "target": "Settings-stack-key-xyz"
}
```

### Deeplinking 
There is no minimal action for deeplinking directly to the `Profile` screen. But because the `Settings_root` is not on the stack, pressing UP will reset the params for navigators to the correct ones.
