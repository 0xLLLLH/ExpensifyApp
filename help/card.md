3. Issue cards to employees, set spending limits, and define company policies for card usage.

### How does the Expensify Card enforce my company’s expense policy?
The Expensify Card automatically enforces your company’s expense policy by:
* Blocking purchases outside of approved categories.
* Enforcing spending limits in real-time.
* Providing real-time visibility into employee spending for managers.

### How do employees submit expenses with the Expensify Card?
Employees don’t need to manually submit expenses with the Expensify Card. Each transaction is automatically recorded, categorized, and attached to an expense report. Receipts are automatically captured and matched with transactions, eliminating the need for manual entry.

### Can I track transactions in real-time?
Yes, the Expensify Card provides real-time visibility into all transactions. Admins and managers can monitor employee spending as it happens, ensuring full control and oversight.

### What rewards do I earn with the Expensify Card?
The Expensify Card offers up to 2% cashback on all purchases. Cashback can be applied directly to reduce your monthly Expensify bill, or used to offset other company expenses.

### How do I control where employees can use their Expensify Cards?
You can control employee card usage by setting vendor and category restrictions. For example, you can restrict cards to be used only for travel-related purchases, or limit spending to certain vendors. These restrictions are enforced at the point of sale.

### [Transaction Issues] Why did my transaction get declined?
Here are some reasons why an Expensify Card transaction might be declined:
- **Insufficient card limit**: If a transaction exceeds your Expensify Card’s available limit, the transaction will be declined. Submitting expenses and getting them approved will free up your limit for more spending.
- **Inactive card**: Your card isn’t active yet or it was disabled by your Domain Admin.
- **Incorrect card details**: Your card information was entered incorrectly with the merchant. Entering incorrect card information, such as the CVC, ZIP, or expiration date, will also lead to declines.
- **Fraudulent or risky activity**: If Expensify detects unusual or suspicious activity, we may block transactions as a security measure. This could happen due to irregular spending patterns, attempted purchases from risky vendors, or multiple rapid transactions. Check your Expensify Home page to approve unusual merchants and try again. If the spending looks suspicious, we may complete a manual due diligence check, and our team will do this as quickly as possible - your cards will all be locked while this happens.

### [Expense Reporting] How do I report my Expensify Card expenses?
You can report and submit Expensify Card expenses just like any other expenses, and you’ll want to submit them regularly to ensure you have a sufficient spending amount available on the card. As your expenses are approved, your Smart Limit updates accordingly.

SmartScanned receipts should automatically attach to the related Expensify Card expense. Expensify also automatically generates an IRS-compliant eReceipt for every transaction as long as the expense isn’t lodging-related. If your organization doesn’t require itemized receipts, you can rely on eReceipts instead.
