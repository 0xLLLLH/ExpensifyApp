## Concepts
Expensify Chat introduces several key features that make it a powerful communication tool.

### [Chat rooms] How do chat rooms work in Expensify Chat?
Chat rooms are the core feature of Expensify Chat, allowing groups of people to collaborate in real-time:
* **Create rooms** - You can create public or private rooms for your team, clients, or vendors. Public rooms are open to anyone in your workspace, while private rooms require an invitation.
* **Invite members** - Invite anyone with an email address or SMS number to join a chat room, even if they aren’t on Expensify yet.
* **Threads** - Keep conversations organized by replying to specific messages in a thread. This is useful for discussing multiple topics in a single room.

### [Admin and Announce Rooms] What are the #admins and #announce rooms?
When a workspace is created, two special chat rooms are automatically generated: `#admins` and `#announce`.

* **#admins**: Exclusively for Workspace Admins to collaborate on workspace management. It includes:
  - Communication with your dedicated Expensify Setup Specialist.
  - Interaction with an Account Manager for subscriptions with 10 or more members.
  - Tracking changes made to Workspace settings.

* **#announce**: Intended for company-wide announcements. By default, all Workspace Members can post here, but permissions can be adjusted to allow only Admins to post.

#### Update messaging permissions in #announce
To allow only admins to post in an `#announce` room:
1. Open the `#announce` room chat from your inbox.
2. Press the room header.
3. Go to **Settings**.
4. Select **Who can post** and choose **Admins only**.

### [Direct messages] What are direct messages?
Direct messages are private, one-on-one conversations between two users:
* **One-to-one messaging** - Use direct messages for private conversations with teammates, clients, or friends.
* **Send files** - Attach images, documents, and links directly in your one-on-one conversations.
* **Searchable** - All direct messages are fully searchable, so you can easily find past conversations or files.

### [File sharing] How do I share files in Expensify Chat?
Expensify Chat makes it easy to share files and attachments:
* **Upload files** - You can upload images, documents, PDFs, and other files directly into any chat room or direct message.
* **Preview files** - View shared files directly in the chat without having to download them.
* **Download files** - All shared files can be downloaded for offline use or further collaboration.

### [Emoji reactions] How do emoji reactions work in Expensify Chat?
Emoji reactions add a fun and efficient way to respond to messages:
* **React to messages** - Simply press the emoji icon under any message to react with an emoji. Reactions are visible to everyone in the conversation.
* **Multiple reactions** - You can add multiple reactions to the same message, and others can join in by adding their own reactions.

### [Threads] How do threaded conversations work?
Threads allow you to keep conversations organized within chat rooms:
* **Reply to a specific message** - Instead of creating a new message, you can reply directly to a previous message to start a thread.
* **View threaded replies** - Threads are nested under the original message, making it easy to follow the conversation.
* **Keep discussions organized** - Threads prevent clutter in busy chat rooms by grouping related messages together.

### [Search] How does search work in Expensify Chat?
Expensify Chat includes a powerful search feature to help you find messages, files, and conversations:
* **Search messages** - Search across all your chat rooms and direct messages to find specific keywords, phrases, or conversations.
* **Search files** - Quickly locate any files shared in chat rooms or direct messages by searching for file names or types.
* **Filter by chat room** - Narrow your search results by limiting them to a specific chat room or direct message.

### [Flagging Messages] How do I flag a message as offensive?
Flagging a message as offensive (including unwanted behavior or offensive messages or attachments) helps escalate it to Expensify’s internal moderation team for review. The person who sent the message will be notified of the flag anonymously, and the moderation team will decide what further action is needed. Depending on the severity of the offense, messages can be hidden (with an option to reveal) or fully removed. In extreme cases, the sender of the message may be temporarily or permanently blocked from posting.

To flag a message:
1. Open the chat in your inbox.
2. Press and hold the message (on mobile) or hover and press the three-dot menu icon (on desktop) at the top right of the message. Then select **Flag as offensive**.
3. Select a category: spam, inconsiderate, intimidation, bullying, harassment, or assault.

### [Reorder Chat Inbox] How can I reorder my chat inbox?
You can customize how chats are displayed in your inbox by pinning important chats and by adjusting message priority settings.

#### Pin a message
To pin a chat to the top of your inbox:
- **Desktop**: Right-click a chat in your inbox and select **Pin**. To unpin, repeat the process and select the pin icon again.
- **Mobile**: Press and hold a chat and select **Pin**. To unpin, repeat the process and tap the pin icon again.

#### Change message priority
To adjust the order of messages based on priority:
1. Press your profile image or icon in the menu.
2. Go to the **Preferences** tab.
3. Select **Priority Mode** and choose either **#focus** or **Most Recent**.
   - **Most Recent**: Sorts all chats by the most recent, with pinned chats at the top.
   - **#focus**: Shows only unread and pinned chats sorted alphabetically.

## Managing Messages

### [Edit or delete messages] How do I edit or delete messages in Expensify Chat?
