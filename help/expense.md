### [QuickBooks Online Export Troubleshooting] Why can't I manually export a report to QuickBooks Online?
To export a report to QuickBooks Online, the report must be in the Approved, Closed, or Reimbursed state. If the report is in the Open state, pressing **Export** will lead to an empty page. Ensure the report is submitted or approved if it's in the Processing state. Once these changes are made, an admin can manually export the report to QuickBooks Online.

When an admin manually exports a report, Expensify will notify them if the report has already been exported. Exporting the data again will create a duplicate report in QuickBooks Online.

- If Auto Sync was disabled when your Workspace was linked to QuickBooks Online, enabling it won’t impact existing reports that haven’t been exported.

### [Workspace Requirement] Why do I need to create a workspace to send an invoice?
A workspace is a configuration of settings related to your business. Since invoicing is considered a business feature, you must have a workspace to configure and use invoicing.

### [Invoice Communication] How do I communicate with the sender/recipient about the invoice?
Expensify will automatically notify the invoice recipient about the new invoice via email, SMS, and a mobile app notification, along with instructions on how to pay it. Daily reminders will be sent until the invoice is paid. Additionally, an invoice chat room will be automatically created in Expensify between the invoice sender, their workspace admins, and the payer. You can use this chat to discuss anything related to the invoice.

### [Invoice Export] Can you export invoices between an accounting integration?

When invoicing is disabled, all previously created invoice rooms and historical invoices will remain unaffected and continue to exist. However, all workspace admins will no longer have the option to send an invoice.

### [Business Bank Account Error] Why am I getting an error after I enter my website when connecting a business bank account?
We can only accept a private domain website to ensure the security of your business. If you receive an error when entering your website, it is likely because the domain is not recognized as private. Make sure you are using a business email with a private domain. If you continue to experience issues, contact our support team at concierge@expensify.com for further assistance.

### [Review Discarded Duplicates] Can I review a discarded duplicate later?

### [Invoice Payment Options] What are the payment options for invoices in Expensify?
When paying an invoice, you can choose to pay as an individual or as a business. You can add a bank account or use a debit or credit card to issue payment.

### [Business Bank Account Requirements] What are the general requirements for adding a business bank account?
To add a business bank account to issue reimbursements via ACH (US) or to issue Expensify Cards:
- Enter a physical address for yourself, any Beneficial Owner (if one exists), and the business associated with the bank account. We cannot accept a PO Box or MailDrop location.
- We are required by law to verify your identity. Part of this process requires you to verify a US-issued photo ID. Your ID must be issued by the United States to use features related to US ACH. You and any Beneficial Owner (if one exists) must also have a US address.

### [Beneficial Owner Definition] What is a Beneficial Owner?
A Beneficial Owner refers to an **individual** who owns 25% or more of the business. If no individual owns 25% or more of the business, the company does not have a Beneficial Owner.

### [Beneficial Owner Details] What do I do if the Beneficial Owner section only asks for personal details, but my organization is owned by another company?
Please indicate you have a Beneficial Owner only if it is an individual who owns 25% or more of the business.

### [Address and ID Verification] Why can’t I input my address or upload my ID?
When adding a verified business bank account in Expensify, the individual adding the account and any beneficial owner (if one exists) are required to have a US address, US photo ID, and a US SSN. If you do not meet these requirements, you’ll need to have another admin add the bank account and then share access with you once it is verified.

### [Document Requests] Why am I asked for documents when adding my bank account?
When a bank account is added to Expensify, we complete a series of checks to verify the information provided to us. We conduct these checks to comply with both our sponsor bank's requirements and federal government regulations, specifically the Bank Secrecy Act / Anti-Money Laundering (BSA / AML) laws. Expensify also has anti-fraud measures in place.

If automatic verification fails, we may request manual verification, which could involve documents such as address verification for your business, a letter from your bank confirming bank account ownership, etc.

If you have any questions regarding the documentation request you received, please contact Concierge and they will be happy to assist.

### [Microtransaction Validation] I don’t see all three microtransactions I need to validate my bank account. What should I do?
Wait until the end of the second business day. If you still don’t see them, please contact your bank and ask them to whitelist our ACH IDs **1270239450**, **4270239450**, and **2270239450**. Expensify’s ACH Originator Name is "Expensify."

Once that's all set, make sure to contact your account manager or concierge, and our team will be able to re-trigger those three test transactions!

### [Test Deposits for Validation] How many test deposits will I receive when validating my business bank account?
You will receive two withdrawals and one deposit in your business bank account to complete the validation process.

### [Missing Test Deposits] What should I do if I don't see the test deposits in my business bank account after two business days?
If the test deposits are not visible after two business days, it may be due to direct debits not being enabled on your bank account. In such cases, provide your bank with the following details:
- ACH CompanyIDs: 1270239450, 4270239450, 2270239450
- ACH Originator Name: Expensify
