## Concepts
The Expensify Superapp has many parts, so let's break them down.

### Superapp
A "superapp" is a single app combining multiple products into one interconnected experience. Expensify isn't a "suite" of separate products but a single app performing multiple functions. Built on a common core:
* **App** - The superapp experience runs on your mobile phone or desktop computer.
* **Chats** - Chat is infused through the entire product, even if not used for enterprise-grade collaboration.
* **Expense** - All products dealing with money ultimately deal with expenses.
* **Workspace** - Expensify shines when used between groups sharing a "workspace."
* **Domain** - Provides extra functionality for members on the same email "domain."

These are the foundational concepts underpinning the superapp.

### App screens
The Expensify App is your window to the connected world of Expensify. Main tools include:
* **Inbox** - Highlights what you should do next, across all products.
* **Search** - Lets you search everything across all products from one place.
* **Settings** - Wraps up personal, workspace, and domain configuration options.
* **Create** - The big green plus button to create anything across all products.

It's a simple app with screens unlocking sophisticated multi-product power.

### Platforms
The Expensify app is available in three forms:
* **Expensify web app** - Accessed at new.expensify.com via mobile or desktop web browser.
* **Expensify mobile app** - Works like the web app but is more reliable and supports notifications.
* **Expensify desktop app** - Similar to the web app but optimized for desktops and supports notifications.

Expensify works on any computer or phone.

### Workspace
A workspace groups members for secure sharing and collaboration. Features include:
* **Name** - Name your workspace anything, it's not globally unique.
* **Profile photo** - Use a headshot or logo, or the assigned one.
* **Description** - Provide details for members with links and information.
* **Currency** - Supports expenses in every currency, converted to one of your choice.
* **Headquarters** - Some products need to know your physical location.

* **Priority mode** - Organized by two modes:
